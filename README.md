# Witchcraft-final-project-with-A-pathfinding-
A final project made way back 

This is a project I made for school way back when.

Its the skeleton of a PVP RTS game in unity, where you cast modular spells and create modular minions to fight your opponent.

Now, it is REALLY old so the code might be nice for 18 years old me, working on his first big project, but its a noodlling shit show really...

I am putting it up mostly to Show I have done something like this, so I can give some impression of the stuff I have done in the past.
